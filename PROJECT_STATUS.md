## Architecture Highlights

### Clean Architecture Principles
- **Separation of Concerns**: Models, Services, Providers, UI
- **Single Responsibility**: Each class has one clear purpose
- **Dependency Injection**: Using Provider for state management

### Privacy-First Design
- **Local-Only Storage**: SQLite database on device
- **No Network Calls**: Completely offline application
- **Secure Data**: User data never leaves the device

### Performance Considerations
- **Efficient Database**: Indexed queries and optimized schema
- **Memory Management**: Proper disposal of controllers and listeners
- **Lazy Loading**: Images and large lists loaded on demand

### User Experience Focus
- **Material Design 3**: Modern, accessible design system
- **Dark Mode Support**: Automatic theme switching
- **Intuitive Navigation**: Bottom navigation with clear icons
- **Emotional Design**: Warm colors and encouraging messaging

This project demonstrates professional Flutter development practices with a focus on user privacy, spiritual wellness, and beautiful user experience.
